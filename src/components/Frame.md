Frame Example:

```js
const markdown = `![OBS Image](https://cdn.door43.org/obs/jpg/360px/obs-en-01-01.jpg)

This is how God made everything in the beginning. He created the universe and everything in it in six days. After God created the earth it was dark and empty because he had not yet formed anything in it. But Godâ€™s Spirit was there over the water.`;
